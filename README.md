# Goldbach's Conjecture / Camp Euclid 2021
The work of Group i don't know of Camp Euclid 2021 for looking different trends through plots on Goldbach's Conjecture. 

We used Numpy and primePy for extracting primes and analyzing the different combinations for writing an even number larger than 2 as the sum of 2 prime numbers. Afterwards, we used Matplotlib to plot our data and color the multiples of some particular numbers in different colors to look for different trends.

Also, we used Prime Number Theorem to look for lower bound and upper bound at the plots we created.
